About

TaxonReportViewer (TRV) is an open-source, cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) software designed to simplify and accelerate the exploration, comparison, and visualization of Kraken2 taxonomic classification outputs. Shotgun metagenomics enables comprehensive analysis of microbial communities by classifying sequencing reads directly from environmental samples, yet interpreting the resulting taxonomic classification reports—especially those generated by tools like Kraken2—remains a challenge due to their hierarchical, text-based format. Existing visualization tools such as Krona and Pavian either rely on web infrastructure or provide limited interactivity and flexibility for comparative analysis.

TRV addresses this critical gap by providing an intuitive and efficient bridge between raw metagenomic classification data and its subsequent biological interpretation. Implemented in Python 3, TRV includes a robust parser capable of accurately reconstructing taxonomic hierarchies even from inconsistently formatted reports. The tool offers dynamic search and filtering of taxa, exportable abundance matrices, one-click generation of comparative bar charts and heatmaps, and direct links to the NCBI Taxonomy database. It supports analysis of multiple samples in parallel, allowing users to identify taxonomic patterns across conditions without requiring programming skills. TRV operates efficiently on standard consumer hardware and requires no installation beyond Python, ensuring accessibility for researchers in diverse computational environments. It functions identically on Windows, Linux and MacOS systems.
